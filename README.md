A sample website for Learn Enough HTML to Be Dangerous

The creation of this website is the result of a step-by-step exercise guided by Michael Hartl's tutorial, Learn Enough HTML to be *Dangerous*.
The finished website should be fully functional in HTML terms, even if it is still missing the CSS touch (*for future development*)
